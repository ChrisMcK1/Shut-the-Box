# Shut the Box Game

# shutTheBox.py is the file to run

First attempt at creating a simple table game called "Shut the Box" in python.

This is a game where the user rolls a pair of dice, and attempts to remove the "board" of number 1-9 by using the sum of their dice roll.  
The user wins by successfully removing each number on the board with equivalent dice rolls.  This game is in a "completed" state in that it works in Python, but the current goal is to create a GUI for the game.
