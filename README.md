# Shut the Box Game

First attempt at creating a simple table game called "Shut the Box" in python.

This is a game where the user rolls a pair of dice, and attempts to remove the "board" of number 1-9 by using the sum of their dice roll.  
The user wins by successfully removing each number on the board with equivalent dice rolls.  There are still tweaks to be made, but in this state the game can be played
until win or failure.
